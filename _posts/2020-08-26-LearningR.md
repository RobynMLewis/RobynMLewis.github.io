title: Learning R
---

Prior to this class I'd taken a course to learn SAS, and had a little bit of familiarity with R, Python, and SQL through other classes. This is the first class where I've actually *learned* to use R instead of just using a few specific functions. Compared to SAS, R feels much more dynamic. Because of the availability of user-defined packages, it's been easy to find a package that does what I need as opposed to manipulating a proc in SAS to try to get the result I need. On the other hand, having limited options for functions meant that I had to be much more familiar with each proc and its capabilities. 

I think R has been much easier to learn and understand, but I don't know if all of the credit can go to R itself. First, now that I've seen a few programming languages I'm more familiar with how they are structured and some of the syntax that is commonly used. Secondly, some of my favorite features of R are actually features of R Studio. I really appreciate having several windows where I can see what objects I've stored, look up documentation for a function, and test smaller chunks of code all in one environment. Lastly, I cannot express how much I love that we don't have to end each command with a semicolon. I've never been so angry at a punctuation mark than when I was learning SAS.
