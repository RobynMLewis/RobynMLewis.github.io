title: Project 2

I think this project was a good example of a real world problem that data scientists analyze- predicting the attributes of an article that will net the most shares. I can understand why previous knowledge of a field is helpful, I had to do research on several variables to understand what they indicated and what their values meant. It seems like many of the included variables are very similar, but may in actuality play very different roles in the number of interactions an article will get. 

The most difficult part of this for me was understanding what exactly the tuning parameters were changing in our model selection, and how that led to our resulting model. It made it a little difficult to pick a starting point, particularly for the boosted tree which has several tuning parameters. I also ran into a few issues with R errors, but I think the more I use it the more I understand how to resolve them. I’m also expected to have a regression tree with more nodes, given the number of variables in the data set. But I am learning that prediction doesn’t always follow what you’d expect, which is part of what makes data analysis so useful.
