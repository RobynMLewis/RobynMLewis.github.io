A brief recap of [Project 1](https://github.com/RobynMLewis/558Project1):

I'm still not entirely sure if I've gotten this onto GitHub correctly, that was probably the toughest part of this project for me. Reading the discussion board helped some, but I definitely felt a bit lost. Another challenging, but not really difficult part of the project was simply the amount of information that we're working with. Keeping track of what information came from which endpoint and how it matched up with other data sources had my head spinning sometimes. I really did appreciate that though, because it felt like these are challenges we'll face in real world projects as well. 

The real difficulties I faced in this project came from the function to call information from the StatsAPI. I approached it several different ways attempting to create a streamlined, logical process that incorporated several different modifiers. I found a few ways that seemed to work but involved long strings of if/else statements. I'd like to practice more with the `switch` function and see if that's something I could improve upon. 

The biggest takeaway for the next project will be just to take more time. Even when I thought I was mostly done with something, I almost never was.
