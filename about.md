Some information about me!

### More Information

I went to UNC Asheville for undergrad where I majored in both Physics and Math. I moved to Raleigh looking for better job opportunities but pretty quickly realized that the jobs I was interested in would need a stronger background in data and statistics. I still miss the mountains and I'd love to move back. 

Until then, I keep myself busy with my two cats, a porch full of plants, cooking, reading and as much outdoor time as I can fit in.
